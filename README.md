To run this project you need to take a GOOGLE MAP KEY at first. Because this key is needed to perform geocoding of user-entered city locations.
I want to put this project on the server after the development is over, so steps 3-5 will not be needed in the future.
  1) Clone this project to your directory
  2) Run "npm install" using the terminal.
  3) Get GOOGLE MAP KEY on this page https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/
  4) Create a .ENV file in a general directory of the project.
  5) In .ENV file create a REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY that will contain your key.
  6) Run "npm start" using the terminal.
